#**Usage Instructions**

This code will automatically replace user - defined shortcuts in the CodeHS editor with a user - defined code segment. 

To start, click on the extension icon. Three fields will appear:

_Shortcut field:_ This is where you can add the shortcut that wiil get replaced. If you want to automatically replace _"sopl"_ with _"System.out.println();"_, this is where you would add _"sopl"_.

_Replacement field:_ This is where you can add the replacement for the shortcut. In the previus example, this is where you would add the _"System.out.println();"_ part.

_End Offset field:_ If you want the cursor to not go to the end when you replace the text, you can change this value. In our case, if you want the cursor to go between the two parentheses when _"System.out.println();"_ is added, you can set this value to                 "2", since the middle of the parentheses is 2 away from the end of the String.
